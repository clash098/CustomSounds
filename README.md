# 🎵 Custom Sounds 🎵

**This is the super awesome tutorial for Custom Sounds by @uhclash!**

Here's how to add a new sound to the sounds folder:
```
1. Download your sound file.
2. Make sure the sound file is either a .mp3, .wav, or .ogg.
3. Then move your sound file to the following folder: ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Gorilla Tag\BepInEx\CustomSounds"", or your ""BepInEx\CustomSounds"" folder.
```

Now, here's how to select the sound file for the mod:
```
1. Open up the following config file: ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Gorilla Tag\BepInEx\config\com.uhclash.gorillatag.CustomSounds.cfg""
2. Under the [Sound Paths] section there is two configs, ""Tag Sound Path"" and ""Round End Sound Path"".
3. There will be a default path, so add the file name of the sound in the ""BepInEx\CustomSounds"" folder.
4. Press CTRL + S to save the config.
```

Then you can go ahead and play, the Custom Sounds won't play if it hasn't been atleast 1 seconds since joining the lobby to avoid issues, but from then on it should work!

Thank you for using my mod, Clash.
